This is *not* actually a list of concrete plans. Many items are just ideas I thought could be neat, but might never make it into the game. I consider Polished Crystal to be basically finished, apart from bugfixes and a few more modernized battle mechanics. There will probably be more features added in future, but the ones that already exist comprise a complete game.


## Use or remove

* Use EMOTE_QUESTION, EMOTE_HAPPY, EMOTE_SAD, and EMOTE_SLEEP somewhere


## Bugs

* Nuzlocke mode sometimes turns on by itself
* Move Reminder doesn't list all possible moves
* TMs refresh PP
* Protect prints (sometimes?) "X is protecting itself! Y's attack missed!"
* Dig sometimes prints that both Pokémon dug a hole
* Per-turn status animations might not always work
* Some trainers use X Spcl. Atk (seems to involve their second item slot, e.g. Lance's Full Restore)
* Thick Club + Swords Dance Marowak Attack overflow (only in link battles?)
* Headbutt overworld animation looks weird (wrong tile ID?)


## Battle mechanics

* http://smogon.com/forums/threads/gsc-mechanics.3542417/
* Gen III critical hit mechanics (ignore -Atk and +Def stat changes, don't ignore burn)
* Defrosted Pokémon can attack on that turn (like waking up)
* Substitute does not block sound-based moves
* Substitute prevents building Rage
* Drain Kiss drains 75% HP
* Avalanche doubles damage if user is hit first (description claims it does this already)
* Thunder, Blizzard, and Hurricane ignore accuracy and evasion in weather (not just 100% accuracy)
* Low Kick's power is based on weight
* Body Slam does double damage against Minimize
* Stomp and Body Slam never miss against Minimize
* Grass-type Pokémon are immune to PoisonPowder, Stun Spore, Sleep Powder, and Spore
* Ghost-type Pokémon are immune to the trapping effects of Mean Look, Clamp, Fire Spin, Whirlpool, and Wrap
* Rock Smash breaks screens instead of lowering Defense (like Brick Break) (non-Faithful)


## Other mechanics

* Use a proper menu for resurrecting Fossils
* Permanently remove Cut trees, smashable rocks, and whirlpools
* Kurt gives Balls right away once per day
* Catch rate formula from Gen III
* Show move stats when overwriting one
* Show stat changes and then absolute values on level up
* Send gift Pokémon to the PC if the party is full
* Separate radio channels for March and Lullaby, available every day
* More Bag pockets (split Items into Items, Medicine, and Berries, or Held and Used)
* Press Start to auto-sort items
* Select reorders Pokémon in party menu
* Longer player and rival names
* Sometimes wild Pokémon know an egg move
* More frequently successful Headbutting
* More likely to find roaming Pokémon when on the correct route
* Give female trainers better DVs, and use the new unique DVs feature to make certain Pokémon female

* Animate new Pokémon sprites (Sylveon, Pikachu, etc)
* Custom Rocket Executive sprites
* Design custom animations for new moves

* Support nicknames for NPC trainers' Pokémon
* Add a portrait for the meteorite in the museum
* Big roofs like Pewter Museum on Silph Co. and Pokémon Tower?
* Goldenrod Dept. Store and Celadon Mansion roofs should have dark sky at night
* Add umbrellas to Olivine City benches

* Merge gray and roof colors on Faraway Island to make room for grass-green
* Edit SPRITE_DRAGON with Dragonite's side view
